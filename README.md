# Turtle-race
Turtle module turtle race project.
This project is an intermediate level python graphics project using module Turtle. In this, we first turtles and them make them move at a random speed by using a random integer pixel distance. 
The turtle_race.py file with message "Pseudo Turtle race" shows the basic working of our project. It helps us understand some of the important concepts of this project, i.e. importing several turtles in different shapes and them move them move at different speeds without any inbuilt speed function.
