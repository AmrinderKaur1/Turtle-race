Turtle module turtle race project.
This project is an intermediate level python graphics project using module Turtle. In this, we first turtles and them make them move at a random speed by using a random integer pixel distance. 
The turtle_race.py file with message "Pseudo Turtle race" shows the basic working of our project. It helps us understand some of the important concepts of this project, i.e. importing several turtles in different shapes and them move them move at different speeds without any inbuilt speed function.
Next, we have my_turtle_race.py file which is the finished product we were looking for. Over here, we first create a track after the user places its bet. Next comes our turtles that rotate themselves to 360 degrees after their arrival. 
Then the GUI asks the user whether to start the race or not i.e. enter yes or no. On the command of yes, the race starts. 
Turtles starts moving at a random pace.
The turtles that finishes the track first, gets declared as the winner. 
Then appears the pop up box that shows the user whether he is won or lost. If the bet he had earlier is the same as the winner turtle, the user is won or else.
In the pop up window the user gets asked to enter an affirmation that can be anything he wants and click OK.
The pop up disappears and the programs gets finished on a click anywhere in the GUI. (i.e. using the screen.exitonclick() turtle function).
Congrats you understood the basic idea behind our mini game. ☺
Best of luck ! ✌
